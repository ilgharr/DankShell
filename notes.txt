### **Header Parameters**:
1. **`kid`**: Key ID used to identify the public key for signature verification.
2. **`alg`**: Algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., `RS256`).

### **Payload Parameters**:
#### **Standard Claims**:
1. **`sub`**: Unique user ID in Cognito (`dc2dd5c8-8081-7054-447b-7dff1cfdcff7`).
2. **`iss`**: Issuer of the token (your Cognito user pool URL).
3. **`aud`**: The intended audience (your app's client ID).
4. **`iat`**: Time when the token was issued (`1737144869`).
5. **`exp`**: Time when the token expires (`1737145169`).

#### **AWS Cognito-Specific Claims**:
1. **`at_hash`**: Hash of the access token (for security).
2. **`cognito:username`**: Cognito-specific unique username for the user.
3. **`event_id`**: Unique ID for the authentication event.
4. **`token_use`**: Indicates token purpose (`id` means this is an ID token).
5. **`email_verified`**: True if the user's email is verified.
6. **`auth_time`**: Time the user authenticated (`1737144869`).
7. **`email`**: User's email address (`ilgharrahno115@gmail.com`).
8. **`jti`**: Unique ID for this token (prevents reuse).
9. **`origin_jti`**: ID of the original token (useful for tracing).

### **Purpose**:
- **Standard Claims** validate the token (expiry, issuer, intended recipient).
- **Cognito-Specific Claims** provide user details (email, username, whether their email is verified).


Checking AWS Cognito token validity
 1. **Signature**: Ensure the signature is valid using the correct public key (found via `kid`) to confirm the token wasn't tampered with and was issued by AWS Cognito.
 2. **Issuer (`iss`)**: Verify the token came from your Cognito User Pool.
 3. **Audience (`aud`)**: Confirm the token is meant for your application (matches your Client ID).
 4. **Token Use (`token_use`)**: Check the token's purpose (`id` or `access`).
 5. **Expiration (`exp`)**: Ensure the token hasn’t expired.
 6. **Issued At (`iat`)**: Confirm the token was issued at a reasonable time.
